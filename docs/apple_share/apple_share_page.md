# Apple Share Extension

The **Apple Share Extension** lets you share **links (URLs)** and **files** from any compatible app (e.g., Safari, YouTube, Files...) directly to the **NoteX AI** app.

Shared content is automatically pre-filled in NoteX and can be processed by AI to create structured, smart notes quickly.
