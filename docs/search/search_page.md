## FAQ

| Question                                                              | Answer                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Q1. Why do I get no results when searching?**                       | Check for typos, try partial matches (e.g., type `"Fut"` instead of `"Future"`), and ensure the note exists. |
| **Q2. Can I search by content type or tag?**                          | Yes. Use filter chips or enter keywords like `"Audio"` or `"Document"` in the search bar.                    |
| **Q3. Does it search inside transcripts or note content?**            | Yes. The search checks both the title and the content of each note, including transcripts.                   |
| **Q4. Can I use voice input to search?**                              | No. Currently, only typed input is supported.                                                                |
| **Q5. Is the search case-sensitive?**                                 | No. Searches are not case-sensitive. You may use any capitalization.                                         |
| **Q6. Are results sorted by date or relevance?**                      | Results are sorted by **relevance and recency**. Filtered results may appear at the top.                     |
| **Q7. Can I search within a specific folder or notebook only?**       | No. Search applies globally across all saved notes.                                                          |
| **Q8. Why do unrelated results appear even after applying a filter?** | Filters act as **priority hints**, not strict constraints. Additional relevant results may still be shown.   |
