# NoteX AI Note Taker - Pricing & Features

## Overview - How NoteX AI Credits Work

NoteX uses **AI credits** to power your note-taking experience. Most features are **count-based** (like "1 per day" or "unlimited"), but **audio recordings have time limits** to ensure optimal AI processing quality.

**Key Points:**

- **Count-based features**: AI summaries, file imports, flashcard sets (limited by quantity)
- **Time-based features**: Audio recordings and transcriptions (limited by duration)
- **Advanced credit features** (com): Premium AI services such as live transcription, quiz video generation, and other high-cost features that utilize advanced processing capabilities.
  For example, free users receive 100 advanced credits monthly, while PRO users receive 1000 credits, with live transcription consuming approximately 50 credits per minute of usage.
- **Recording limits**: Basic (60 min), PRO+ (6 hours) per conversation
- **Daily resets**: All daily limits refresh every 24 hours (based on our system timestamp)
- **Unlimited Definition**: Our "Unlimited" plans include 1000 unrestricted credits per month (35 daily) and 3000 minutes of recording monthly. To ensure service quality and prevent misuse, additional limits may be applied once quotas are depleted.
  **Loyalty/Referral Program**: Users can earn "Reward credits" which can be used as a universal replacement for all credit types to access any NoteX features through referral programs and daily check-ins to maximize their usage potential. ([Read more](https://docs-notex.com))

**Credit System Refresh Schedule**

Our credit system refreshes daily at **GMT +0 (Greenwich Mean Time)**. This means the refresh time will vary depending on your local timezone.

**For example:**

- If you're in **GMT +10** (like Sydney, Australia), your credits will refresh at **10:00 AM** your local time
- If you're in **GMT -5** (like New York, USA), your credits will refresh at **7:00 PM** your local time the previous day
- If you're in **GMT +8** (like Singapore), your credits will refresh at **8:00 AM** your local time

**To find your refresh time:**
Simply add or subtract your timezone offset from GMT +0.

**Example calculation for GMT +10:**
GMT +0 refresh time (00:00) + 10 hours = 10:00 AM your local time

This ensures all users worldwide have their credits refreshed at the same moment, just displayed in their local timezone.
