# NoteX Filter & Sort Component Documentation

## Overview

The **Filter & Sort** component is a convenient dropdown panel that helps you quickly organize and find your notes in the "All Notes" tab. Instead of scrolling through everything, you can filter by content type or change how your notes are arranged. It's like having a smart filing system right at your fingertips!

## 7. FAQ

**Q: Do my filter settings save when I close the app?**
A: No! NoteX resets to the default settings ("All Notes" and "Newest First") each time you open the app, so you'll need to reapply your preferred filters and sorting if you want a different view.

---
**Q: Can I filter by multiple content types at once?**
A: Currently, you can only filter by one content type at a time. Use "All Notes" to see everything, then sort as needed.

---
**Q: What happens if I have no notes of a certain type?**
A: You can still select that filter - you'll just see an empty list. This is actually helpful for confirming you don't have any content of that type.

---
**Q: Does filtering affect my folders and shared notes?**
A: No, filtering only works in the "All Notes" tab. Your folders and shared content have their own organization systems.

---
**Q: Can I search within a filtered view?**
A: Absolutely! Use the search icon (🔍) at the top while any filter is active - it will only search within the filtered results.

---
**Q: Does sorting affect how new notes appear?**
A: New notes always follow your current sort setting. If you're using "Newest First," new notes appear at the top. If you're using alphabetical sorting, they'll appear in the right alphabetical position.
