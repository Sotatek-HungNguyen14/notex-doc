## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I keep my notes organized?**
A: Great question! Tap the three dots next to any note and choose "Move to Folder." You can also select multiple notes at once to organize them faster.

**Q: Oops, I deleted a note by mistake! Can I get it back?**
A: Unfortunately, deleted notes are gone for good. Here's a tip: instead of deleting, try moving notes to a folder called "Archive" - that way you can always find them later!

**Q: What's the difference between "Export" and "Share Note"?**
A: Think of Export as "send a copy somewhere else" (like saving to Google Drive), while Share Note means "let my friends work on this with me" - it's for real-time collaboration.

**Q: My note has been saying "Creating Note..." forever. What's going on?**
A: This usually happens with longer voice recordings or bigger files. It's just taking time to process everything. Grab a coffee - it'll be ready soon! If you have a slow internet connection, it might take a bit longer.

**Q: How do I find a specific note when I have tons of them?**
A: Easy! Tap the magnifying glass (üîç) at the top of your screen. You can search by the note's title, what's inside it, or any tags you've added.

**Q: I accidentally turned on that selection mode with all the checkboxes. How do I get out?**
A: No worries! Just tap "Cancel" at the top right of your screen and you'll be back to normal browsing mode.
