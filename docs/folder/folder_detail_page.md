The app will ask if you want to keep the notes (and move them somewhere else) or delete everything together.

---

### How do I stop selecting multiple items?

Tap the "Cancel" button at the top right, or use the back button to return to normal viewing.

### Why do folders and notes have different menu options?

Each type of item has actions that make sense for it. Folders can have notes added to them, while individual notes can be exported or shared.
