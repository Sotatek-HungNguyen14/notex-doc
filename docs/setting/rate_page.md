No. Tapping the option will open your device’s browser or store app, taking you out of the NoteX app temporarily.

---

### Do I need to write a review or just rate?  
Only a star rating is required. Writing a review is optional but highly appreciated.

---

### Can I rate the app again later?  
Yes. You can revisit the **Rate Us on Store** option anytime to update or revise your rating and review.

### Is my rating anonymous?
