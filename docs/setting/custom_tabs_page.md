# Customize Note Tabs

---

## 1. Overview

The **Customize Note Tabs** feature lets you choose which of these learning tabs you want to see inside your notes. This allows you to hide tools you don't need and focus on what's most important for your study style.

By default, every note you create will show all available tabs.

### Key Benefits

- Remove distractions by hiding unused tabs
- Customize the layout to suit your workflow
- Streamline the interface for faster access to essential tools

## 4. Why Customize Your Note Tabs?

- **Focus on What Matters:** Hide tabs you don’t use (e.g. Transcript) to reduce clutter.
- **Create a Personal Workflow:** Keep the tools that matter most—like **Flashcards**—always visible.
- **Simplify Your View:** A cleaner layout improves focus and helps you find information faster.
