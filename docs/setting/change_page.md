| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light  | Bright background with dark text. Ideal for well-lit environments.                                                                       |
| Dark   | Dark background with light text. Helps reduce eye strain in dark settings and may save battery on OLED screens.                          |
| System | Automatically syncs with your device’s current theme setting. If your device is in Dark Mode, the app will also be dark, and vice versa. |

## Notes and Tips

- System mode is recommended if you want the app to follow your device’s theme settings.
- This feature only works on devices that support system-wide theme switching (e.g., iOS 13+, Android 10+).
- Your selected theme will be saved automatically and applied the next time you open the app.
