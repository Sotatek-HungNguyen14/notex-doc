# Nova AI Chat

**Nova AI Chat** is a smart assistant integrated into **NoteX**, designed to help users deeply explore AI-processed content from various formats‚Äîrecordings, documents, images, and web links.

- **Smart information extraction**: action items, timelines, involved people, etc.
- **Compatible with multiple formats**: audio, documents, images, links.
- **Great for both work and learning**: summarizing, reporting, sharing.
